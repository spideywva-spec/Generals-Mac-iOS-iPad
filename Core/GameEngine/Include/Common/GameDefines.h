// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 13/09/2026 Match the simulation switches the
// GeneralsOnline client is built with, so a match against one can agree with it.
//
// A PC-hosted match now starts and runs, and then the two simulations disagree
// at the first CRC exchange: frame 100, this device AD768702, the PC 9EAFC02B.
// The cause is not the architecture. Upstream guards these defaults with
// defined(GENERALS_ONLINE) and turns them all off for its own client; this
// port, whose GameDefines.h came from TheSuperHackers where that macro does not
// exist, left them on. They are not cosmetic -- RETAIL_COMPATIBLE_CRC alone
// changes which bytes go into the per-frame checksum (m_objectUpgradesCompleted
// is hashed as eight bytes with it on, and as the full bit field with it off),
// so two simulations doing exactly the same thing still report different
// numbers. The other three change pathfinding allocation, AIGroup behaviour and
// save/xfer layout, all of which feed the simulation.
//
// Set unconditionally rather than by mirroring upstream's GENERALS_ONLINE
// guard, for the reason the networking switch below gives: that macro is added
// by GeneralsMD's CMakeLists and never reaches Core's targets, and a switch
// this deep resolving differently per target would be far worse than either
// value. This port is only ever a GeneralsOnline client -- retail's servers are
// gone -- so there is nothing on the other side of these to stay compatible
// with.
//
// The three PRESERVE_* switches above are deliberately NOT changed. Upstream
// gates those on GENERALS_ONLINE_COMMUNITY_PATCH_CHANGES as well, and that is
// defined in NextGenMP_defines.h, which GameDefines.h does not include and
// PreRTS.h does not pull in first -- so in the shipped client they resolve to
// the retail branch, which is what this file already has.
//
// Changing these changes this build's checksums: an older build and this one
// will now disagree with each other exactly as this port and the PC did.

// The GeneralsOnline client never defines this symbol at all, so every #if on it in

// A* search itself: at AIPathfind.cpp:1309 the start cell is opened with m_open = TRUE on this
// side and FALSE on the client's, because s_useFixedPathfinding is initialised false and only

//
// GeneralsOnline builds with this off (upstream guards the default with
// !defined(GENERALS_ONLINE)), which makes its UDP payloads up to 1100 bytes
// against retail's 476, its TransportMessage::data correspondingly wider, and
// its command-id ordering overflow-safe. This port had it on, so a PC-hosted
// match and this device disagreed about the size and shape of every game
// packet -- and nothing catches that: the lobby compares INI and EXE
// checksums, not the transport, so the match starts, the loading screen sits
// at 0%, and the peer eventually times out. A device log of exactly that shows
// 268 packets from the PC rejected as "Is NOT a generals packet".
//
// Set here rather than by mirroring upstream's GENERALS_ONLINE guard on
// purpose: that macro is added by GeneralsMD's CMakeLists and so does not
// reach Core's own targets, which compile NetworkDefs.h too. Guarding on it
// would give one binary two different TransportMessage layouts depending on
// which target a translation unit landed in, which is worse than either value.
